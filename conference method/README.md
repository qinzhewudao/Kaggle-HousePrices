## What's next?

1. Tune parameters: You have some examples and can tweak their parameters very easily. It will help you to understand the behaviors of them.

2. Survey methods: After trying tuning the parameters, you'll understand the method in the behavior level. Then, let's survey the method in detail. It is very important to know how it works.

3. Try other apploaches: It's time to try other methods. I'm very happy that you program nice methods based on my scripts.
